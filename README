This is a little widget do show graphically Unicamp's cafeteria("bandeco") menu.
(aka "bandej√£o", lit. "large tray")

The data is read from the site by curl, parsed with php/regex and a JSONP is 
generated.

Then, that info is imported into a SVG, with javascript to handle it and show 
the apropriate drawing[todo], also showing text when the mouse is over each 
section of the tray.
